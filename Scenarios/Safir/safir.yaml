# In this scenario, a version of https://github.com/mrc-ide/safir3 is emulated inside Pandemia.

# ######################################### Basic Parameters #######################################

# [KEY PARAMETER] Scale factor. This rescales the number of individuals, locations, and other
# relevant quantities appearing in the world and simulation components.
scale_factor: 0.0005
# Profiler. If True then performance data is saved in a file called profiler_output. The parameter
# pstats_records determines how many lines to print in the profiler report.
profile: False
pstats_records: 100
# [KEY PARAMETER] Random seed. Pandemia is stochastic and therefore requires a random seed.
random_seed: 1
# Parallel processing. The parameter num_jobs sets the maximum number of CPUs to used by the
# simulator. If num_jobs < 1 then this maximum is os.cpu_count().
enable_parallel: True

# ######################################### Clock ##################################################

# Length of time step, in seconds. Must divide the day length (86400 seconds).
tick_length_s: 28800
# [KEY PARAMETER] Length of the simulation, in days.
simulation_length_days: 365
# [KEY PARAMETER] The date on which the simulation starts.
epoch: 1st January 2020

# ######################################### World ##################################################

# The Pandemia simulator acts on a world. The world consists of regions, with each region consisting
# of individuals, locations and activities. The world additionally consists of a travel matrix,
# indicating how many individuals travel from each region to each other region each day. The world
# is built using a world factory. The choice of world factory, and its configuration, are made here.

world_factory:
  # The HeterogeneousWorldFactory builds a world consisting of, at most, around two hundred regions,
  # with each region representing a real-world country. The recommended scale factor is therefore
  # 0.0005. It implements a simple model of hetergeneous mixing, based on average household size and
  # population density grids.
  __type__: heterogeneous_world_factory.HeterogeneousWorldFactory
  # [KEY PARAMETER] This world factory is stochastic, and therefore gets its own random seed.
  random_seed: 1

  # agents is given by multiplying this data by the scale_factor.

  # There are two activities, Home_Activity and Community_Activity. Individuals perform the
  # Home_Activity in their assigned House, while they perform the Community_Activity in randomly
  # selected grid squares, with the random selection being weighted by distance. Individuals
  # above or below certain ages do not perform the Community_Activity. Those who do perform the
  # Community_Activity do so for 8 hours each weekday, between 8am and 4pm.

  # The list of grid squares for each individual is obtained by sampling from a subset of all
  # such squares in the region. The subset contains the local_sample_size squares nearest their

  # Then num_locs_for_community_activity square are randomly sampled from this subet.
  local_sample_size: 500
  nonlocal_sample_size: 500
  # For an individual with House in Square1, the weight attached to a Square2 is given by the
  # gravity model formula:
  #   weight = population_size(Square2) / (1 + distance(Square1, Square2)^gamma)
  # where gamma = gravity_model_exponent.
  gravity_model_exponent: 0.5
  # Individuals travel between regions either by air or not. If not, then travel is between adjacent
  # regions, with this parameter determining the proportion of each population travelling to
  # adjacent regions each day.
  local_travel_prob_per_day: 0.0
  # This is used to determine region adjacency, in the units of the shape file.

# ######################################### Seasonal Effects #######################################

seasonal_effects_model:
  # The seasonal effects component of the Pandemia simulator can be used to configure monthly
  # updates to parameter values, for example the regional transmission multipliers. The

  # alternative value is set by the parameter out_of_season_multiplier.
